# Introduction to functions in python
'''
Functions is a programming construct. It takes an input, does some computation and returns an output.
There are two types of functions in python:
    1. Built-in functions: 
                                These are functions that are built into python. They are always available for use.
                                Examples are: print(), len(), type(), etc.
    2. User-defined functions:

                                These are functions that are defined by the user. They are created using the def keyword.
                                Examples are:  def function_name(parameters):
Benefits of functions is code reusability. You can write a function once and use it as many times as you want.

Principal of functions: 
    1. Abstraction: only worry about what the function does, not how it does it.
    2. Decomposition: Break down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable problems.
